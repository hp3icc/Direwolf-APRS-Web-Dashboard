/*
Example startup command for Direwolf with specification of packet logfiles directory and Direwolf Console output redirection to console.log file:

** LINUX   -> /usr/bin/direwolf -c /etc/direwolf.conf -l /var/log/direwolf -daknpwtoihfxd - > /var/log/direwolf/console.log

** WINDOWS -> direwolf.exe -c "C:\direwolf\direwolf.conf" -l "C:\direwolf\logs" -daknpwtoihfx - > "C:\direwolf\logs\console.log"

Depending on debug options turned on, console.log can become very big over time! Restarting direwolf empties console.log so implementing scheduled restarts and/or limiting debug options is suggested

Direwolf debug options (from Direwolf manual version 1.7):

    -d             Debug options:
       a             a = AGWPE network protocol client.
       k             k = KISS serial port or pseudo terminal client.
       n             n = KISS network client.
       u             u = Display non-ASCII text in hexadecimal.
       p             p = dump Packets in hexadecimal.
       g             g = GPS interface.
       w             w = Waypoints for Position or Object Reports.
       t             t = Tracker beacon.
       o             o = output controls such as PTT and DCD.
       i             i = IGate.
       m             m = Monitor heard station list.
       f             f = packet Filtering.
       x             x = FX.25 increase verbose level.
       2             2 = IL2P.
       d             d = APRStt (DTMF to APRS object translation).
