# Direwolf APRS Web Dashboard for Linux and Windows

This Direwolf APRS Web Dashboard offers all kinds of information for both Operators and Users of a Direwolf-based APRS iGate node, which is not easily visible through a user interface of Direwolf itself.

The dashboard aggregates and visualizes information from the the Direwolf radio interface packet logfiles, from the Direwolf console, from aprs.fi and aprsdirect.de, from the connected APRS-IS server, and from the Linux Operating System. See this video for an introduction to the dashboard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bMf7rWCfnE

This dashboard is made by Michael PC7MM and Richard PD3RFR and finds it roots in the code of Alfredo IZ7BOJ, who developed direwolf_webstat in 2021 and APRS_dashboard in 2018, and with this we express our gratitude for his work and inspiration! Alfredo can be found on github via https://github.com/IZ7BOJ

## Instructions for installation and configuration on Linux

Since every single setup is differrent, universal installation and configuration instructions cannot easily be given. Having stated that as a disclaimer, the instructions as mentioned below serve as a guideline and will most likely result in a running Direwolf APRS Web Dashboard on Debian-based hosts.

Update your Operating System:

    sudo apt-get update -y ; sudo apt-get upgrade -y

Install (latest version of) PHP and required modules:

    sudo apt-get install php8.2-common php8.2-cgi php -y

Install and configure lighttpd, a lightweight webserver:

    sudo apt-get install lighttpd -y

    sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi

    sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi-php

    sudo service lighttpd force-reload

Download or clone all files of this repository to your home directory and copy the files in the "code" folder to /var/www/html/

	sudo git clone https://github.com/PC7MM/Direwolf-APRS-Web-Dashboard ~/Direwolf-APRS-Web-Dashboard 

	sudo cp ~/Direwolf-APRS-Web-Dashboard/code/* /var/www/html/

Open config.php and carefully adjust the parameters as needed for your specific situation. 
	
	sudo nano /var/www/html/config.php

Change the Direwolf startup command to request Direwolf creating both packet logfiles and a console logfile, for example:

	/usr/bin/direwolf -c /etc/direwolf.conf -l /var/log/direwolf -daknpwtoihfxd - > /var/log/direwolf/console.log

## Instructions for installation and configuration of Windows

Download the Abyss X1 Web Server via https://aprelium.com/abyssws/download.php and run the installer

Enable PHP support for the Abyss X1 Webserver as explained on https://aprelium.com/abyssws/php.html

Download or clone all files of this repository to the Downloads directory and copy the files in the "code" folder to C:\Abyss Web Server\htdocs\

        git clone https://github.com/PC7MM/Direwolf-APRS-Web-Dashboard C:\users\<user>\Downloads\Direwolf-APRS-Web-Dashboard

        copy C:\users\<user>\Downloads\Direwolf-APRS-Web-Dashboard\code\*.* C:\Abyss Web Server\htdocs\

Open config.php and carefully adjust the parameters as needed for your specific situation. 

        notepad C:\Abyss Web Server\htdocs\config.php

Change the Direwolf startup command to request Direwolf creating both packet logfiles and a console logfile, for example:

	direwolf.exe -c "C:\direwolf\direwolf.conf" -l "C:\direwolf\logs" -daknpwtoihfx - > "C:\direwolf\logs\console.log"

Direwolf for Windows might write console output in a 4kB output buffer instead of writing it directly to the console logfile. If such a buffer is being used, information in the Web Console Viewer will only be updated after Direwolf flushes that buffer.

## Instruction video

PD3RFR and PC7MM made a video that explains how to setup an RX-only iGate with RTL-SDR from scratch. This video was made before this Direwolf APRS Web Dashboard was made, so it is not refered to in the video. The video explains however how direwolf_webstat as made by Alfredo IZ7BOJ needs to be installed, and this procedure is equal to installing this Direwolf APRS Web Dashboard.
